# Feature Requests

When working with this codebase and you identify a missing feature that would significantly help your workflow:

## When to Create a Feature Request

Create a feature request when you:
- Need functionality that doesn't exist yet
- Find yourself working around a limitation repeatedly
- Identify a pattern that could be automated
- Think of an enhancement during autonomous trading or analysis

## How to Create

1. Create a markdown file in `docs/feature-requests/`
2. Use a descriptive filename: `feature-name.md`
3. Include these sections:
   - **Problem**: What limitation you encountered
   - **Proposed Solution**: API design, parameters, response format
   - **Use Cases**: Concrete examples of how it would be used
   - **Priority**: Low/Medium/High based on impact
   - **Implementation Notes**: Technical considerations

## Don't Forget

During autonomous trading sessions, if you think "I wish I could wait for X" or "It would be easier if I could Y" - create a feature request immediately before continuing.
